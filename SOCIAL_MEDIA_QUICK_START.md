🧵 Thread: I built GhostIndex to solve a problem every job seeker faces

1/ Ever applied to a company and never heard back? Not even a rejection?

That's "ghosting," and it's become the norm in hiring.

But what if you could see which companies do this BEFORE applying?
```

2/ Introducing GhostIndex: A transparency platform for job seekers

- Search 90+ companies
- See their "Ghost Index Score" (0-100)
- Read verified reports from real applicants
- Submit your own experience

https://getghostindex.com
```

**Tweet 3 (Reply to Tweet 2):**
```
3/ How it works:

Companies with HIGH scores (70+) = High ghosting rate
Companies with LOW scores (0-40) = Actually respond to candidates

All data is verified via email confirmation forwarding.
```

**Tweet 4 (Reply to Tweet 3):**

4/ Why this matters:

Job searching is already stressful. You shouldn't waste time on companies that won't even acknowledge your application.

GhostIndex helps you focus your energy where it counts.
