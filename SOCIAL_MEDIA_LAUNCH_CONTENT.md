### Day 2 - Educational Thread

**Tweet 1:**
```
🎓 What is a Ghost Index Score?

It's a 0-100 rating that shows how likely a company is to ghost you during the hiring process.

Here's how we calculate it 🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
We analyze:
• % of verified ghosting reports
• Response time patterns
• Auto-ghost detection (30 days of silence)
• Historical communication data

Higher score = higher ghosting risk
Lower score = better communication
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Why verified reports matter:

❌ No anonymous complaints
❌ No subjective reviews
✅ Email-confirmed applications only
✅ Auto-ghost detection after 30 days
✅ 100% data-driven

Transparency you can trust.
```

### Day 3 - Thought Leadership

```
The Hidden Cost of Ghosting in Hiring

Every year, millions of job seekers are ghosted by companies. The impact goes beyond frustration:

• Wasted time and emotional energy (avg. 2-3 hours per application)
• Reduced trust in the hiring process
• Negative employer brand perception
• Lost talent opportunities for companies

At GhostIndex, we're creating transparency through verified data. Our Ghost Index Scores help job seekers make informed decisions and help companies understand the real impact of their communication practices.

The solution isn't complicated:
1. Acknowledge receipt of applications
2. Set clear timeline expectations
3. Send rejection emails (even automated)
4. Close the loop with candidates

What's your take? How can we improve hiring communication?

### Day 5 - Feature Highlight

```
🤖 Introducing Auto-Ghost Detection

One of GhostIndex's key features: If a company doesn't respond within 30 days of your verified application, we automatically mark it as "ghosted."

Why 30 days?
• Industry standard for reasonable response time
• Gives companies adequate time to review
• Prevents indefinite waiting
• Creates accountability

How it works:
1. Submit and verify your application
2. We monitor for 30 days
3. No response? Auto-flagged as ghosted
4. Ghost Index Score updated

This feature ensures our data stays current and accurate, even when companies don't respond.
