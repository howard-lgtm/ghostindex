## The Problem vs. The Solution

### ❌ The Problem

**Job seekers are being ghosted at unprecedented rates.**

- 75% of job applications receive no response whatsoever
- Candidates invest hours in applications, interviews, and assessments — only to be met with silence
- There's no accountability for companies that ghost candidates
- Job seekers have no way to know which companies communicate well before applying
- The power imbalance in hiring leaves candidates frustrated and disrespected

**The result:** Wasted time, damaged confidence, and a broken hiring system that treats candidates as disposable.

---

### ✅ The Solution: GhostIndex

**We're bringing transparency to the hiring process.**

GhostIndex tracks how companies treat job candidates and assigns each company a **Ghost Index Score (0-100)** based on verified candidate experiences.

**How it works:**
1. **Apply** — Submit your job application as normal
2. **Report** — Tell us about your experience on GhostIndex
3. **Verify** — Forward your application confirmation email to verify your report
4. **Track** — After 30 days of silence, your report is automatically flagged as "ghosted"
5. **Score** — The company's Ghost Index Score updates to reflect real candidate experiences

**The impact:**
- Job seekers can research companies before applying
- Companies are held accountable for their hiring practices
- Good employers stand out from the crowd
- The hiring process becomes more respectful for everyone
