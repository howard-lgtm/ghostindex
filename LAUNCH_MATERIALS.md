# GhostIndex: A Transparency Platform for Job Seekers

**TL;DR:** I built a platform that tracks which companies ghost job applicants. Search companies, see their "Ghost Index Score," and share your experience. Live now at https://getghostindex.com

## The Problem

If you've ever applied for a job, you know the frustration:
- You spend hours crafting the perfect application
- You never hear back
- Not even a rejection email
- Complete radio silence

This is "ghosting," and it's become normalized in hiring. But it doesn't have to be this way.

## The Solution

GhostIndex is a transparency platform that:

1. **Tracks ghosting rates** - We calculate a "Ghost Index Score" (0-100) for each company based on verified reports
2. **Verified reports** - Users forward their job application confirmation emails to verify their experience
3. **Detailed company profiles** - See all reports, statistics, and trends for any company
4. **Auto-ghosting detection** - If no response after 30 days, we automatically mark it as ghosted

## How It Works

1. **Search** - Look up any company (90+ indexed so far)
2. **View Score** - See their Ghost Index Score and risk level
3. **Read Reports** - See what other applicants experienced
4. **Submit Your Own** - Share your experience to help others

## The Data

- **91 companies** indexed (FAANG, Big Tech, startups)
- **35 verified reports** (growing daily)
- **Ghost Index Scores** calculated in real-time
- **Email verification** ensures data quality

## Why I Built This

As a job seeker, I was tired of the information asymmetry. Companies have all the data about candidates, but candidates have no data about companies' hiring practices.

GhostIndex levels the playing field. If a company consistently ghosts applicants, that should be public information.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 16, React, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)
- **Email:** Mailgun for verification
- **Hosting:** Vercel
- **Security:** Rate limiting, input sanitization, RLS

## What's Next

This is a beta launch. I'm looking for:
- **Feedback** on the UX and features
- **Reports** from real job seekers
- **Company suggestions** to add to the database
- **Ideas** for improving the platform

## Try It Now

**https://getghostindex.com**

Sign in with LinkedIn, search for companies, and see their Ghost Index Scores.

If you've been ghosted, submit a report and help others avoid the same fate.

🧵 Thread: I built GhostIndex to solve a problem every job seeker faces

1/ Ever applied to a company and never heard back? Not even a rejection?

That's "ghosting," and it's become the norm in hiring.

But what if you could see which companies do this BEFORE applying?

2/ Introducing GhostIndex: A transparency platform for job seekers

- Search 90+ companies
- See their "Ghost Index Score" (0-100)
- Read verified reports from real applicants
- Submit your own experience

https://getghostindex.com

3/ How it works:

Companies with HIGH scores (70+) = High ghosting rate
Companies with LOW scores (0-40) = Actually respond to candidates

All data is verified via email confirmation forwarding.

4/ Why this matters:

Job searching is already stressful. You shouldn't waste time on companies that won't even acknowledge your application.

GhostIndex helps you focus your energy where it counts.

5/ This is a beta launch. I'm looking for:

✅ Feedback on the platform
✅ Reports from job seekers
✅ Company suggestions
✅ Ideas for improvement

Try it: https://getghostindex.com

Let's make hiring more transparent. 👻

Title: I built a platform that tracks which companies ghost job applicants

Hey everyone,

I'm a developer who got tired of being ghosted by companies, so I built GhostIndex - a transparency platform for job seekers.

**What it does:**
- Tracks which companies ghost applicants
- Calculates a "Ghost Index Score" (0-100) for each company
- Shows verified reports from real job seekers
- Helps you avoid wasting time on companies that won't respond

**How it works:**
1. Search for any company (90+ indexed)
2. See their Ghost Index Score and risk level
3. Read reports from other applicants
4. Submit your own experience (verified via email)

**Why I built it:**
Job searching is already stressful. The least companies can do is acknowledge your application. If they consistently ghost people, that should be public information.

**Link:** https://getghostindex.com

This is a beta launch. I'd love your feedback!

**Tech stack:** Next.js, Supabase, Mailgun, Vercel

Happy to answer any questions!
