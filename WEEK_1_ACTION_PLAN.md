Hi [Name],

I'm building a platform to bring transparency to hiring practices and would love to get your perspective as someone on the front lines of recruiting.

I'm conducting 20-minute discovery interviews with recruiters to understand the biggest challenges in candidate communication and experience. No sales pitch - just genuinely trying to learn from practitioners like you.

Would you be open to a quick call this week or next? Happy to work around your schedule.

Thanks for considering,
Howard
```

**Email Template (if you have their email):**
```
Subject: Quick input from a recruiting pro?

Hi [Name],

I'm researching hiring transparency and candidate experience, and your expertise would be incredibly valuable.

I'm conducting brief (20 min) discovery interviews with recruiters to understand:
- Biggest pain points in candidate communication
- How you measure and improve responsiveness
- What tools/data would actually be useful

No sales pitch - just learning from people who do this work every day.

Would you have 20 minutes this week or next for a quick call?

Best,
Howard

P.S. Happy to share anonymized insights from other interviews if that's helpful to you.

**Minutes 2-15: Discovery Questions**

*Start with pain points:*
1. "Walk me through your typical week - how much time goes to candidate follow-up?"
2. "What's the most frustrating part of your hiring workflow right now?"
3. "Have you ever lost a great candidate because your process was too slow?"

*Explore ghosting (both directions):*
4. "How often do candidates ghost you after interviews?"
5. "When you can't respond to every applicant, how do you handle that?"
6. "Do you think companies in your industry have a reputation problem with candidate experience?"

*Test value proposition:*
7. "If there was a public score showing how responsive companies are to applicants, would that concern you or excite you?"
8. "Would you pay for a tool that helped you improve your company's candidate response metrics?"
9. "How would you use data showing your company's hiring responsiveness compared to competitors?"

*Validate features:*
10. "If you could see which of your job postings were being flagged as 'ghost jobs' by applicants, would you act on that?"
11. "Would a 'verified responsive employer' badge be valuable for your job postings?"

**Minutes 15-18: Open Discussion**
- "What am I not asking that I should be?"
- "What tools do you currently use for candidate experience?"
- "If you could wave a magic wand, what would you fix about hiring?"

**Minutes 18-20: Wrap-Up**
- Thank them again
