# GhostIndex — Investor Overview

**Making Hiring Transparent**

*January 2026*

---

## The Opportunity

### The Problem

**75% of job applications receive no response.**

- 250M+ job applications submitted annually in the US alone
- Candidates invest 30+ hours per job search on average
- Companies face zero accountability for ghosting candidates
- No data exists on employer responsiveness — until now

**The result:** A broken hiring market where candidates have no visibility into which employers will actually respond.

---

### The Solution

**GhostIndex is the transparency layer for hiring.**

We track how companies treat job candidates and assign each employer a **Ghost Index Score (0-100)** based on verified candidate experiences.

**How it works:**
1. Job seekers report their application experiences
2. Reports are verified via forwarded confirmation emails
3. After 30 days of silence, reports auto-flag as "ghosted"
4. Company scores update daily based on aggregate data

**The result:** Job seekers research companies before applying. Companies are held accountable for their hiring practices.

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Focus | Our Advantage |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| **Glassdoor** | Employee reviews | Focused on hiring process, not employment |
| **LinkedIn** | Professional network | Specific to ghosting, verified data |
| **Indeed** | Job listings | Transparency data, not job posts |
| **Blind** | Anonymous reviews | Verification system, monetization model |

**Moat:** Email verification creates verified, high-quality data that competitors can't easily replicate.
